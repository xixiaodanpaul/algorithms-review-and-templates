# 69. Sqrt\(x\)

## Question

Given a non-negative integer `x`, compute and return _the square root of_ `x`.

Since the return type is an integer, the decimal digits are **truncated**, and only **the integer part** of the result is returned.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: x = 4
Output: 2
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: x = 8
Output: 2
Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since the decimal part is truncated, 2 is returned.
```

**Constraints:**

* `0 <= x <= 2^31 - 1`

## Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int mySqrt(int x) {
        // sol: binary search (upper bound)
        if (x == 1) {
            return 1;
        }
        long left = 1, right = (long) x;
        while (left < right) {
            long mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (mid * mid <= x) {
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                right = mid;
            }
        }
        return left - 1;
    }
};
```
