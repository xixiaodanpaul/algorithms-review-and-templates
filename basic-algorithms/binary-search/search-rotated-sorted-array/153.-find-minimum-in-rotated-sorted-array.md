# 153. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array

## Question

Suppose an array of length `n` sorted in ascending order is **rotated** between `1` and `n` times. For example, the array `nums = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might become:

* `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]` if it was rotated `4` times.
* `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` if it was rotated `7` times.

Notice that **rotating** an array `[a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]]` 1 time results in the array `[a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]]`.

Given the sorted rotated array `nums` of **unique** elements, return _the minimum element of this array_.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: nums = [3,4,5,1,2]
Output: 1
Explanation: The original array was [1,2,3,4,5] rotated 3 times.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
Output: 0
Explanation: The original array was [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] and it was rotated 4 times.
```

**Example 3:**

```text
Input: nums = [11,13,15,17]
Output: 11
Explanation: The original array was [11,13,15,17] and it was rotated 4 times. 
```

**Constraints:**

* `n == nums.length`
* `1 <= n <= 5000`
* `-5000 <= nums[i] <= 5000`
* All the integers of `nums` are **unique**.
* `nums` is sorted and rotated between `1` and `n` times.

## Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findMin(vector<int>& nums) {
        // sol: binary search
        int left = 0, right = nums.size() - 1;
        while (left < right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (nums[mid] < nums[right]) { // right is sorted (use right to check)
                right = mid;
            } else {
                left = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        return nums[left];
    }
};
```
