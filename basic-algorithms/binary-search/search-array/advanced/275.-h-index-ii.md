# 275. H-Index II

## Question

Given an array of integers `citations` where `citations[i]` is the number of citations a researcher received for their `ith` paper and `citations` is sorted in an **ascending order**, return compute the researcher's `h`**-index**.

According to the [definition of h-index on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-index): A scientist has an index `h` if `h` of their `n` papers have at least `h` citations each, and the other `n âˆ’ h` papers have no more than `h` citations each.

If there are several possible values for `h`, the maximum one is taken as the `h`**-index**.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: citations = [0,1,3,5,6]
Output: 3
Explanation: [0,1,3,5,6] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 0, 1, 3, 5, 6 citations respectively.
Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, their h-index is 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: citations = [1,2,100]
Output: 2
```

**Constraints:**

* `n == citations.length`
* `1 <= n <= 105`
* `0 <= citations[i] <= 1000`
* `citations` is sorted in **ascending order**.

**Follow up:** Could you solve it in logarithmic time complexity?

## Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int hIndex(vector<int>& citations) {
        // sol: binary search (lower bound)
        int n = citations.size();
        int left = 0, right = n;
        while (left < right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (citations[mid] >= n - mid) { // find the first index >= (the number of index >= it)
                right = mid;
            } else {
                left = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        return n - left;
    }
};
```
