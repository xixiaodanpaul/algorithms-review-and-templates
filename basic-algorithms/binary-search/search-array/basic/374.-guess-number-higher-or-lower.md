# 374. Guess Number Higher or Lower

## Question

We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

I pick a number from `1` to `n`. You have to guess which number I picked.

Every time you guess wrong, I will tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower than your guess.

You call a pre-defined API `int guess(int num)`, which returns 3 possible results:

* `-1`: The number I picked is lower than your guess \(i.e. `pick < num`\).
* `1`: The number I picked is higher than your guess \(i.e. `pick > num`\).
* `0`: The number I picked is equal to your guess \(i.e. `pick == num`\).

Return _the number that I picked_.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: n = 10, pick = 6
Output: 6
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: n = 1, pick = 1
Output: 1
```

**Example 3:**

```text
Input: n = 2, pick = 1
Output: 1
```

**Example 4:**

```text
Input: n = 2, pick = 2
Output: 2
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= n <= 2^31 - 1`
* `1 <= pick <= n`

## Solution

```cpp
/** 
 * Forward declaration of guess API.
 * @param  num   your guess
 * @return 	     -1 if num is lower than the guess number
 *			      1 if num is higher than the guess number
 *               otherwise return 0
 * int guess(int num);
 */

class Solution {
public:
    int guessNumber(int n) {
        // sol: binary search
        int left = 1, right = n;
        while (left < right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            int t = guess(mid);
            if (t == 0) {
                return mid;
            }
            if (t == -1) {
                right = mid;
            } else {
                left = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        return left;
    }
};
```
