# 435. Non-overlapping Intervals

## Question

Given a collection of intervals, find the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,3]]
Output: 1
Explanation: [1,3] can be removed and the rest of intervals are non-overlapping.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: [[1,2],[1,2],[1,2]]
Output: 2
Explanation: You need to remove two [1,2] to make the rest of intervals non-overlapping.
```

**Example 3:**

```text
Input: [[1,2],[2,3]]
Output: 0
Explanation: You don't need to remove any of the intervals since they're already non-overlapping.
```

**Note:**

1. You may assume the interval's end point is always bigger than its start point.
2. Intervals like \[1,2\] and \[2,3\] have borders "touching" but they don't overlap each other.

## Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int eraseOverlapIntervals(vector<vector<int>>& intervals) {
        // sol: sort (track last reserved element)
        int res = 0, last = 0;
        sort(intervals.begin(), intervals.end());
        for (int i = 1; i < intervals.size(); ++i) {
            if (intervals[i][0] < intervals[last][1]) {
                ++res;
                if (intervals[i][1] < intervals[last][1]) { // remove the interval with larger end
                    last = i;
                }
            } else {
                last = i;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
