# 296. Best Meeting Point

## Question

Given an `m x n` binary grid `grid` where each `1` marks the home of one friend, return _the minimal **total travel distance**_.

The **total travel distance** is the sum of the distances between the houses of the friends and the meeting point.

The distance is calculated using [Manhattan Distance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_geometry), where `distance(p1, p2) = |p2.x - p1.x| + |p2.y - p1.y|`.

**Example 1:**![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/14/meetingpoint-grid.jpg)

```text
Input: grid = [[1,0,0,0,1],[0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,1,0,0]]
Output: 6
Explanation: Given three friends living at (0,0), (0,4), and (2,2).
The point (0,2) is an ideal meeting point, as the total travel distance of 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 is minimal.
So return 6.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: grid = [[1,1]]
Output: 1
```

**Constraints:**

* `m == grid.length`
* `n == grid[i].length`
* `1 <= m, n <= 200`
* `grid[i][j]` is either `0` or `1`.
* There will be **at least two** friends in the `grid`.

## Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minTotalDistance(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        // sol: sort, from 1D to 2D (row and column), two pointers
        vector<int> rows, cols;
        for (int i = 0; i < grid.size(); ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < grid[0].size(); ++j) {
                if (grid[i][j] == 1) {
                    rows.push_back(i);
                    cols.push_back(j);
                }
            }
        }
        sort(cols.begin(), cols.end()); // rows is already sorted
        int res = 0, left = 0, right = rows.size() - 1;
        while (left < right) {
            res += (rows[right] - rows[left]) + (cols[right] - cols[left]); // add distance by pair
            ++left;
            --right;
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
