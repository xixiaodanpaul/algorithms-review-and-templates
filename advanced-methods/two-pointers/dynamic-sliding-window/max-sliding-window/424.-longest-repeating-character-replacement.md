# 424. Longest Repeating Character Replacement

## Question

Given a string `s` that consists of only uppercase English letters, you can perform at most `k` operations on that string.

In one operation, you can choose **any** character of the string and change it to any other uppercase English character.

Find the length of the longest sub-string containing all repeating letters you can get after performing the above operations.

**Note:**  
Both the string's length and k will not exceed 10^4.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input:
s = "ABAB", k = 2

Output:
4

Explanation:
Replace the two 'A's with two 'B's or vice versa.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input:
s = "AABABBA", k = 1

Output:
4

Explanation:
Replace the one 'A' in the middle with 'B' and form "AABBBBA".
The substring "BBBB" has the longest repeating letters, which is 4.
```

## Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int characterReplacement(string s, int k) {
        // sol: two pointers (sliding window)
        int left = 0, right = 0, max_cnt = 0, res = 0;
        vector<int> m(256, 0);
        while (right < s.size()) {
            max_cnt = max(max_cnt, ++m[s[right++]]);
            while (right - left - max_cnt > k) {
                --m[s[left++]]; // do not need to check reduce max_cnt because it will not increase max window size
            }
            res = max(res, right - left);
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
