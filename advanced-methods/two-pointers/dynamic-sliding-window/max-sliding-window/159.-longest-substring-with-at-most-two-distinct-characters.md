# 159. Longest Substring with At Most Two Distinct Characters

## Question

Given a string `s`, return _the length of the longest substring that contains at most **two distinct characters**_.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: s = "eceba"
Output: 3
Explanation: The substring is "ece" which its length is 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: s = "ccaabbb"
Output: 5
Explanation: The substring is "aabbb" which its length is 5.
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= s.length <= 10^4`
* `s` consists of English letters.

## Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int lengthOfLongestSubstringTwoDistinct(string s) {
        // sol: hashmap, two pointers (sliding window)
        unordered_map<char, int> m; // map char to frequency
        int left = 0, right = 0, cnt = 0, res = 0;
        while (right < s.size()) {
            if (m[s[right++]]++ == 0) {
                ++cnt;
            }
            while (cnt > 2) {
                if (--m[s[left++]] == 0) {
                    --cnt;
                }
            }
            res = max(res, right - left);
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
