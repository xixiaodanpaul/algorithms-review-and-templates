# 350. Intersection of Two Arrays II

## Question

Given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, return _an array of their intersection_. Each element in the result must appear as many times as it shows in both arrays and you may return the result in **any order**.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: nums1 = [1,2,2,1], nums2 = [2,2]
Output: [2,2]
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: nums1 = [4,9,5], nums2 = [9,4,9,8,4]
Output: [4,9]
Explanation: [9,4] is also accepted.
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= nums1.length, nums2.length <= 1000`
* `0 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 1000`

**Follow up:**

* What if the given array is already sorted? How would you optimize your algorithm?
* What if `nums1`'s size is small compared to `nums2`'s size? Which algorithm is better?
* What if elements of `nums2` are stored on disk, and the memory is limited such that you cannot load all elements into the memory at once?

## Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> intersect(vector<int>& nums1, vector<int>& nums2) {
        // sol1: hashmap
        // map<int, int> m; // map number to frequency
        // vector<int> res;
        // for (auto& num : nums1) {
        //     ++m[num];
        // }
        // for (auto& num : nums2) {
        //     if (--m[num] >= 0) {
        //         res.push_back(num);
        //     }
        // }
        // return res;
        
        // sol2: sort, two pointers
        vector<int> res;
        int i = 0, j = 0;
        sort(nums1.begin(), nums1.end());
        sort(nums2.begin(), nums2.end());
        while (i < nums1.size() && j < nums2.size()) {
            if (nums1[i] < nums2[j]) {
                ++i;
            } else if (nums1[i] > nums2[j]) {
                ++j;
            } else {
                res.push_back(nums1[i]);
                ++i;
                ++j;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```

**Follow up:**

1. What if the given array is already sorted? How would you optimize your algorithm?
   * We can use method 2, dropping the sort of course. It will give us linear time and constant memory complexity.
2. What if `nums1` 's size is small compared to `nums2` 's size? Which algorithm is better?
   * Method 1 is a good choice here as we use a hash map for the smaller array.
3. What if elements of _nums2_ are stored on disk, and the memory is limited such that you cannot load all elements into the memory at once?
   * If `nums1` fits into the memory, we can use method 1 to collect counts for `nums1` into a hash map. Then, we can sequentially load and process `nums2`.
   * If neither of the arrays fit into the memory, we can apply some partial processing strategies:
     * Split the numeric range into subranges that fits into the memory. Modify method 1to collect counts only within a given subrange, and call the method multiple times \(for each subrange\).
     * Use an **external sort** for both arrays. Modify method 2 to load and process arrays sequentially.
