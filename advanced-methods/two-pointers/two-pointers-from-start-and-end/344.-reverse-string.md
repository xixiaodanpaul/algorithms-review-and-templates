# 344. Reverse String

## Question

Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters `s`.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: s = ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= s.length <= 10^5`
* `s[i]` is a [printable ascii character](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#Printable_characters).

**Follow up:** Do not allocate extra space for another array. You must do this by modifying the input array [in-place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm) with `O(1)` extra memory.

## Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    void reverseString(vector<char>& s) {
        // sol: two pointers
        int left = 0, right = s.size() - 1;
        while (left < right) {
            swap(s[left++], s[right--]);
        }
    }
};
```
