# 245. Shortest Word Distance III

## Question

Given an array of strings `wordsDict` and two strings that already exist in the array `word1` and `word2`, return _the shortest distance between these two words in the list_.

**Note** that `word1` and `word2` may be the same. It is guaranteed that they represent **two individual words** in the list.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: wordsDict = ["practice", "makes", "perfect", "coding", "makes"], word1 = "makes", word2 = "coding"
Output: 1
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: wordsDict = ["practice", "makes", "perfect", "coding", "makes"], word1 = "makes", word2 = "makes"
Output: 3
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= wordsDict.length <= 3 * 10^4`
* `1 <= wordsDict[i].length <= 10`
* `wordsDict[i]` consists of lowercase English letters.
* `word1` and `word2` are in `wordsDict`.

## Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int shortestWordDistance(vector<string>& words, string word1, string word2) {
        // sol: two pointers
        int pos1 = -1, pos2 = -1, res = INT_MAX;
        for (int i = 0; i < words.size(); ++i) {
            if (word1 == word2) {
                int pre = -1;
                if (words[i] == word1) {
                    pre = pos1;
                    pos1 = i;
                }
                if (pos1 != -1 && pre != -1) {
                    res = min(res, abs(pos1-pre));
                }
            } else {
                if (words[i] == word1) {
                    pos1 = i;
                } else if (words[i] == word2) {
                    pos2 = i;
                }
                if (pos1 != -1 && pos2 != -1) {
                    res = min(res, abs(pos1-pos2));
                }
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
