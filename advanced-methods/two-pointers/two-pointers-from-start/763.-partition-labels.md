# 763. Partition Labels

## Question

A string `S` of lowercase English letters is given. We want to partition this string into as many parts as possible so that each letter appears in at most one part, and return a list of integers representing the size of these parts.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: S = "ababcbacadefegdehijhklij"
Output: [9,7,8]
Explanation:
The partition is "ababcbaca", "defegde", "hijhklij".
This is a partition so that each letter appears in at most one part.
A partition like "ababcbacadefegde", "hijhklij" is incorrect, because it splits S into less parts.
```

**Note:**

* `S` will have length in range `[1, 500]`.
* `S` will consist of lowercase English letters \(`'a'` to `'z'`\) only.

## Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> partitionLabels(string S) {
        // sol: hashmap, two pointers (update max end position)
        int n = S.size();
        unordered_map<char, int> m; // map char to last appeared position
        int start = 0, end = 0;
        vector<int> res;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            m[S[i]] = i;
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            end = max(end, m[S[i]]);
            if (i == end) {
                res.push_back(end - start + 1);
                start = end + 1;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
