# 351. Android Unlock Patterns

## Question

Android devices have a special lock screen with a `3 x 3` grid of dots. Users can set an "unlock pattern" by connecting the dots in a specific sequence, forming a series of joined line segments where each segment's endpoints are two consecutive dots in the sequence. A sequence of `k` dots is a **valid** unlock pattern if both of the following are true:

* All the dots in the sequence are **distinct**.
* If the line segment connecting two consecutive dots in the sequence passes through any other dot, the other dot **must have previously appeared** in the sequence. No jumps through non-selected dots are allowed.

Here are some example valid and invalid unlock patterns:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/10/12/android-unlock.png)

* The 1st pattern `[4,1,3,6]` is invalid because the line connecting dots `1` and `3` pass through dot `2`, but dot `2` did not previously appear in the sequence.
* The 2nd pattern `[4,1,9,2]` is invalid because the line connecting dots `1` and `9` pass through dot `5`, but dot `5` did not previously appear in the sequence.
* The 3rd pattern `[2,4,1,3,6]` is valid because it follows the conditions. The line connecting dots `1` and `3` meets the condition because dot `2` previously appeared in the sequence.
* The 4th pattern `[6,5,4,1,9,2]` is valid because it follows the conditions. The line connecting dots `1` and `9` meets the condition because dot `5` previously appeared in the sequence.

Given two integers `m` and `n`, return _the **number of unique and valid unlock patterns** of the Android grid lock screen that consist of **at least**_ `m` _keys and **at most**_ `n` _keys._

Two unlock patterns are considered **unique** if there is a dot in one sequence that is not in the other, or the order of the dots is different.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: m = 1, n = 1
Output: 9
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: m = 1, n = 2
Output: 65
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= m, n <= 9`

## Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numberOfPatterns(int m, int n) {
        // sol: backtracking
        vector<vector<int>> jumps(10, vector<int>(10, 0)); // jumps[i][j]: number between i and j
        vector<bool> visited(10, false);
        int res = 0;
        jumps[1][3] = jumps[3][1] = 2;
        jumps[4][6] = jumps[6][4] = 5;
        jumps[7][9] = jumps[9][7] = 8;
        jumps[1][7] = jumps[7][1] = 4;
        jumps[2][8] = jumps[8][2] = 5;
        jumps[3][9] = jumps[9][3] = 6;
        jumps[1][9] = jumps[9][1] = jumps[3][7] = jumps[7][3] = 5;
        for (int i = 1; i <= 9; ++i) {
            helper(i, 1, res, jumps, visited, m, n);
        }
        return res;
    }
    
    void helper(int cur, int len, int& res, vector<vector<int>>& jumps, vector<bool>& visited, int m, int n) {
        if (len > n) {
            return;
        }
        if (len >= m) {
            ++res;
        }
        visited[cur] = true;
        for (int i = 1; i <= 9; ++i) {
            int jump = jumps[cur][i];
            if (!visited[i] && (jump == 0 || visited[jump])) {
                helper(i, len + 1, res, jumps, visited, m, n);
            }
        }
        visited[cur] = false;
    }
};
```
