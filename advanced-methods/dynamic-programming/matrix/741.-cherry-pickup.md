# 741. Cherry Pickup

## Question

You are given an `n x n` `grid` representing a field of cherries, each cell is one of three possible integers.

* `0` means the cell is empty, so you can pass through,
* `1` means the cell contains a cherry that you can pick up and pass through, or
* `-1` means the cell contains a thorn that blocks your way.

Return _the maximum number of cherries you can collect by following the rules below_:

* Starting at the position `(0, 0)` and reaching `(n - 1, n - 1)` by moving right or down through valid path cells \(cells with value `0` or `1`\).
* After reaching `(n - 1, n - 1)`, returning to `(0, 0)` by moving left or up through valid path cells.
* When passing through a path cell containing a cherry, you pick it up, and the cell becomes an empty cell `0`.
* If there is no valid path between `(0, 0)` and `(n - 1, n - 1)`, then no cherries can be collected.

**Example 1:**![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/12/14/grid.jpg)

```text
Input: grid = [[0,1,-1],[1,0,-1],[1,1,1]]
Output: 5
Explanation: The player started at (0, 0) and went down, down, right right to reach (2, 2).
4 cherries were picked up during this single trip, and the matrix becomes [[0,1,-1],[0,0,-1],[0,0,0]].
Then, the player went left, up, up, left to return home, picking up one more cherry.
The total number of cherries picked up is 5, and this is the maximum possible.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: grid = [[1,1,-1],[1,-1,1],[-1,1,1]]
Output: 0
```

**Constraints:**

* `n == grid.length`
* `n == grid[i].length`
* `1 <= n <= 50`
* `grid[i][j]` is `-1`, `0`, or `1`.
* `grid[0][0] != -1`
* `grid[n - 1][n - 1] != -1`

## Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int cherryPickup(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        // sol: 3D dp (two paths simutaneously)
        int n = grid.size();
        vector<vector<vector<int>>> dp(n + 1, vector<vector<int>>(n + 1, vector<int>(n + 1, -1)));
        dp[1][1][1] = grid[0][0];
        for (int x1 = 1; x1 <= n; x1++){
            for (int y1 = 1; y1 <= n; y1++){
                for (int x2 = 1; x2 <= n; x2++){
                    int y2 = x1 + y1 - x2; // x1 + y2 = x2 + y2
                    if (y2 < 1 || y2 > n || grid[x1-1][y1-1] < 0 || grid[x2-1][y2-1] < 0) {
                        continue;
                    }
                    int max_pre = max(dp[x1-1][y1][x2], max(dp[x1][y1-1][x2], max(dp[x1-1][y1][x2-1], dp[x1][y1-1][x2-1])));
                    if (max_pre == -1) {
                        continue;
                    }
                    dp[x1][y1][x2] = max_pre + grid[x1-1][y1-1];
                    if (x1 != x2) {
                        dp[x1][y1][x2] += grid[x2-1][y2-1];
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        return max(dp[n][n][n], 0);
    }
};
```
