# 188. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock IV

## Question

You are given an integer array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day, and an integer `k`.

Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete at most `k` transactions.

**Note:** You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously \(i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again\).

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: k = 2, prices = [2,4,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 2) and sell on day 2 (price = 4), profit = 4-2 = 2.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: k = 2, prices = [3,2,6,5,0,3]
Output: 7
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 2) and sell on day 3 (price = 6), profit = 6-2 = 4. Then buy on day 5 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.
```

**Constraints:**

* `0 <= k <= 100`
* `0 <= prices.length <= 1000`
* `0 <= prices[i] <= 1000`

## Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(int k, vector<int>& prices) {
        // sol: two 2D dp arrays
        int n = prices.size();
        if (k >= n) {
            return maxProfit(prices);
        }
        vector<vector<int>> global(n, vector<int>(k + 1, 0)); // global[i][j]: max profit to sell before or at i, with <= j transactions
        vector<vector<int>> local(n, vector<int>(k + 1, 0)); // local[i][j]: max profit to sell at i, with <= j transactions
        for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
            int diff = prices[i] - prices[i-1];
            for (int j = 1; j <= k; ++j) {
                local[i][j] = max(local[i-1][j] + diff, global[i-1][j-1] + max(diff, 0)); // to understand this equation!
                global[i][j] = max(local[i][j], global[i-1][j]);
            }
        }
        return global[n-1][k];
    }
    
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        int res = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < prices.size(); ++i) {
            if (prices[i] > prices[i-1]) {
                res += prices[i] - prices[i-1];
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
