# 265. Paint House II

## Question

There are a row of `n` houses, each house can be painted with one of the `k` colors. The cost of painting each house with a certain color is different. You have to paint all the houses such that no two adjacent houses have the same color.

The cost of painting each house with a certain color is represented by an `n x k` cost matrix costs.

* For example, `costs[0][0]` is the cost of painting house `0` with color `0`; `costs[1][2]` is the cost of painting house `1` with color `2`, and so on...

Return _the minimum cost to paint all houses_.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: costs = [[1,5,3],[2,9,4]]
Output: 5
Explanation:
Paint house 0 into color 0, paint house 1 into color 2. Minimum cost: 1 + 4 = 5; 
Or paint house 0 into color 2, paint house 1 into color 0. Minimum cost: 3 + 2 = 5.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: costs = [[1,3],[2,4]]
Output: 5
```

**Constraints:**

* `costs.length == n`
* `costs[i].length == k`
* `1 <= n <= 100`
* `1 <= k <= 20`
* `1 <= costs[i][j] <= 20`

**Follow up:** Could you solve it in `O(nk)` runtime?

## Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minCostII(vector<vector<int>>& costs) {
        // sol: dp with two variables (record top two min values and min index)
        if (costs.empty() || costs[0].empty()) {
            return 0;
        }
        int m = costs.size(), n = costs[0].size();
        int min1 = 0, min2 = 0, min_idx = -1;
        for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
            int cur_min1 = INT_MAX, cur_min2 = INT_MAX, cur_min_idx = -1;
            for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
                int cost = costs[i][j] + (min_idx == j ? min2 : min1);
                if (cost < cur_min1) {
                    cur_min2 = cur_min1;
                    cur_min1 = cost;
                    cur_min_idx = j;
                } else if (cost < cur_min2) {
                    cur_min2 = cost;
                }
            }
            min1 = cur_min1;
            min2 = cur_min2;
            min_idx = cur_min_idx;
        }
        return min1;
    }
};
```
