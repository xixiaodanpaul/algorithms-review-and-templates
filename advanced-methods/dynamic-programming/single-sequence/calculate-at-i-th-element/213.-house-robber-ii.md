# 213. House Robber II

## Question

You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed. All houses at this place are **arranged in a circle.** That means the first house is the neighbor of the last one. Meanwhile, adjacent houses have a security system connected, and **it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night**.

Given an integer array `nums` representing the amount of money of each house, return _the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight **without alerting the police**_.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: nums = [2,3,2]
Output: 3
Explanation: You cannot rob house 1 (money = 2) and then rob house 3 (money = 2), because they are adjacent houses.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.
```

**Example 3:**

```text
Input: nums = [0]
Output: 0
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= nums.length <= 100`
* `0 <= nums[i] <= 1000`

## Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int rob(vector<int>& nums) {
        // sol: two conditions (rob 0 or n-1)
        int n = nums.size();
        if (n <= 1) {
            return n == 0 ? 0 : nums[0];
        }
        return max(helper(0, n - 2, nums), helper(1, n - 1, nums));
    }
    
    int helper(int start, int end, vector<int>& nums) {
        int rob = 0, nrob = 0;
        for (int i = start; i <= end; ++i) {
            int pre_rob = rob, pre_nrob = nrob;
            rob = pre_nrob + nums[i];
            nrob = max(pre_rob, pre_nrob);
        }
        return max(rob, nrob);
    }
};
```
