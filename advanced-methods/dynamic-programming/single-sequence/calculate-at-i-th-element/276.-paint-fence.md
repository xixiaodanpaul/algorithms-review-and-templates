# 276. Paint Fence

## Question

You are painting a fence of `n` posts with `k` different colors. You must paint the posts following these rules:

* Every post must be painted **exactly one** color.
* **At most one pair** of adjacent fence posts can have the same color.

Given the two integers `n` and `k`, return _the **number of ways** you can paint the fence_.

**Example 1:**![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/02/28/paintfenceex1.png)

```text
Input: n = 3, k = 2
Output: 6
Explanation: All the possibilities are shown.
Note that painting all the posts red or all the posts green is invalid because there can only be at most one pair of adjacent posts that are the same color.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: n = 1, k = 1
Output: 1
```

**Example 3:**

```text
Input: n = 7, k = 2
Output: 42
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= n <= 50`
* `1 <= k <= 10^5`
* The answer is guaranteed to be in the range `[0, 2^31 - 1]` for the given `n` and `k`.

## Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numWays(int n, int k) {
        // sol: dp with two variables
        if (n == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        int same = 0; // last two are same color
        int diff = k; // last two are different colors
        for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
            int pre_diff = diff;
            diff = (same + diff) * (k - 1);
            same = pre_diff;
        }
        return same + diff;
    }
};
```
