# 1048. Longest String Chain

## Question

Given a list of words, each word consists of English lowercase letters.

Let's say `word1` is a predecessor of `word2` if and only if we can add exactly one letter anywhere in `word1` to make it equal to `word2`. For example, `"abc"` is a predecessor of `"abac"`.

A _word chain_ is a sequence of words `[word_1, word_2, ..., word_k]` with `k >= 1`, where `word_1` is a predecessor of `word_2`, `word_2` is a predecessor of `word_3`, and so on.

Return the longest possible length of a word chain with words chosen from the given list of `words`.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: words = ["a","b","ba","bca","bda","bdca"]
Output: 4
Explanation: One of the longest word chain is "a","ba","bda","bdca".
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: words = ["xbc","pcxbcf","xb","cxbc","pcxbc"]
Output: 5
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= words.length <= 1000`
* `1 <= words[i].length <= 16`
* `words[i]` only consists of English lowercase letters.

## Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int longestStrChain(vector<string>& words) {
        // sol: sort, hashmap, 1D dp
        auto cmp = [](string& s1, string& s2) {
            return s1.size() < s2.size();
        };
        sort(words.begin(), words.end(), cmp);
        unordered_map<string, int> m; // store word chain length
        int res = 0;
        for (auto word : words) {
            m[word] = 1;
            for (int i = 0; i < word.size(); ++i) {
                string tmp = word.substr(0, i) + word.substr(i + 1);
                if (m.count(tmp)) {
                    m[word] = max(m[word], m[tmp] + 1);
                }
            }
            res = max(res, m[word]);
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
