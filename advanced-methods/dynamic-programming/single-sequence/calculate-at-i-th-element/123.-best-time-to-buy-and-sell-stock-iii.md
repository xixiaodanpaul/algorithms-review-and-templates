# 123. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock III

## Question

You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day.

Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete **at most two transactions**.

**Note:** You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously \(i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again\).

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: prices = [3,3,5,0,0,3,1,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: Buy on day 4 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.
Then buy on day 7 (price = 1) and sell on day 8 (price = 4), profit = 4-1 = 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: prices = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.
```

**Example 3:**

```text
Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
```

**Example 4:**

```text
Input: prices = [1]
Output: 0
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= prices.length <= 10^5`
* `0 <= prices[i] <= 10^5`

## Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        // sol: two 2D dp arrays
        if (prices.empty()) {
            return 0;
        }
        int n = prices.size();
        vector<vector<int>> global(n, vector<int>(3, 0)); // global[i][j]: max profit to sell before or at i, with <= j transactions
        vector<vector<int>> local(n, vector<int>(3, 0)); // local[i][j]: max profit to sell at i, with <= j transactions
        for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
            int diff = prices[i] - prices[i-1];
            for (int j = 1; j <= 2; ++j) {
                local[i][j] = max(local[i-1][j] + diff, global[i-1][j-1] + max(0, diff));
                global[i][j] = max(global[i-1][j], local[i][j]);
            }
        }
        return global[n-1][2];
    }
};
```
