# 740. Delete and Earn

## Question

Given an array `nums` of integers, you can perform operations on the array.

In each operation, you pick any `nums[i]` and delete it to earn `nums[i]` points. After, you must delete **every** element equal to `nums[i] - 1` or `nums[i] + 1`.

You start with `0` points. Return the maximum number of points you can earn by applying such operations.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: nums = [3,4,2]
Output: 6
Explanation: Delete 4 to earn 4 points, consequently 3 is also deleted.
Then, delete 2 to earn 2 points.
6 total points are earned.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: nums = [2,2,3,3,3,4]
Output: 9
Explanation: Delete 3 to earn 3 points, deleting both 2's and the 4.
Then, delete 3 again to earn 3 points, and 3 again to earn 3 points.
9 total points are earned.
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= nums.length <= 2 * 10^4`
* `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`

## Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int deleteAndEarn(vector<int>& nums) {
        // sol: dp with two variables
        vector<int> sums(10001, 0); // sums[i]: sum of all i's in the array
        int take = 0, skip = 0;
        for (auto& num : nums) {
            sums[num] += num;
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < 10001; ++i) {
            int pre_take = take, pre_skip = skip;
            take = pre_skip + sums[i];
            skip = max(pre_take, pre_skip);
        }
        return max(take, skip);
    }
};
```
