# 376. Wiggle Subsequence

## Question

A **wiggle sequence** is a sequence where the differences between successive numbers strictly alternate between positive and negative. The first difference \(if one exists\) may be either positive or negative. A sequence with two or fewer elements is trivially a wiggle sequence.

* For example, `[1, 7, 4, 9, 2, 5]` is a **wiggle sequence** because the differences `(6, -3, 5, -7, 3)` alternate between positive and negative.
* In contrast, `[1, 4, 7, 2, 5]` and `[1, 7, 4, 5, 5]` are not wiggle sequences. The first is not because its first two differences are positive, and the second is not because its last difference is zero.

A **subsequence** is obtained by deleting some elements \(possibly zero\) from the original sequence, leaving the remaining elements in their original order.

Given an integer array `nums`, return _the length of the longest **wiggle subsequence** of_ `nums`.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: nums = [1,7,4,9,2,5]
Output: 6
Explanation: The entire sequence is a wiggle sequence with differences (6, -3, 5, -7, 3).
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: nums = [1,17,5,10,13,15,10,5,16,8]
Output: 7
Explanation: There are several subsequences that achieve this length.
One is [1, 17, 10, 13, 10, 16, 8] with differences (16, -7, 3, -3, 6, -8).
```

**Example 3:**

```text
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
Output: 2
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`
* `0 <= nums[i] <= 1000`

**Follow up:** Could you solve this in `O(n)` time?

## Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int wiggleMaxLength(vector<int>& nums) {
        // sol1: record diff sign
        // if (nums.empty()) {
        //     return 0;
        // }
        // int cur = 0, pre = 0, res = 1;
        // for (int i = 1; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
        //     if (nums[i] > nums[i-1]) {
        //         cur = 1;
        //     } else if (nums[i] < nums[i-1]) {
        //         cur = -1;
        //     }
        //     if (cur != pre) {
        //         ++res;
        //     }
        //     pre = cur;
        // }
        // return res;
        
        // sol2: dp with two variables
        if (nums.empty()) {
            return 0;
        }
        int pos = 1, neg = 1; // wiggle subsequence length ending with pos/neg diff
        for (int i = 1; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
            if (nums[i] > nums[i-1]) {
                pos = neg + 1;
            } else if (nums[i] < nums[i-1]) {
                neg = pos + 1;
            }
        }
        return max(pos, neg);
    }
};
```
