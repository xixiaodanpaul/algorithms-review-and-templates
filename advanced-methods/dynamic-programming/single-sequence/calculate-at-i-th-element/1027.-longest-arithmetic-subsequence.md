# 1027. Longest Arithmetic Subsequence

## Question

Given an array `A` of integers, return the **length** of the longest arithmetic subsequence in `A`.

Recall that a _subsequence_ of `A` is a list `A[i_1], A[i_2], ..., A[i_k]` with `0 <= i_1 < i_2 < ... < i_k <= A.length - 1`, and that a sequence `B` is _arithmetic_ if `B[i+1] - B[i]` are all the same value \(for `0 <= i < B.length - 1`\).

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: A = [3,6,9,12]
Output: 4
Explanation: 
The whole array is an arithmetic sequence with steps of length = 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: A = [9,4,7,2,10]
Output: 3
Explanation: 
The longest arithmetic subsequence is [4,7,10].
```

**Example 3:**

```text
Input: A = [20,1,15,3,10,5,8]
Output: 4
Explanation: 
The longest arithmetic subsequence is [20,15,10,5].
```

**Constraints:**

* `2 <= A.length <= 1000`
* `0 <= A[i] <= 500`

## Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int longestArithSeqLength(vector<int>& A) {
        // sol: 2D dp
        int n = A.size();
        vector<vector<int>> dp(n, vector<int>(2000, 1)); // dp[i][j]: max length ending at A[i] with step diff j
        int res = 1;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < i; ++j) {
                int diff = A[i] - A[j] + 1000; // diff can be negative
                dp[i][diff] = max(dp[i][diff], dp[j][diff] + 1);
                res = max(res, dp[i][diff]);
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
