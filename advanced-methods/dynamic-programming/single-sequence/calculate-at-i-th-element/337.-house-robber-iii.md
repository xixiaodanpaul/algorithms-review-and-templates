# 337. House Robber III

## Question

The thief has found himself a new place for his thievery again. There is only one entrance to this area, called `root`.

Besides the `root`, each house has one and only one parent house. After a tour, the smart thief realized that all houses in this place form a binary tree. It will automatically contact the police if **two directly-linked houses were broken into on the same night**.

Given the `root` of the binary tree, return _the maximum amount of money the thief can rob **without alerting the police**_.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: root = [3,2,3,null,3,null,1]
Output: 7
Explanation: Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = 3 + 3 + 1 = 7.
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/10/rob2-tree.jpg)

```text
Input: root = [3,4,5,1,3,null,1]
Output: 9
Explanation: Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = 4 + 5 = 9.
```

**Constraints:**

* The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 10^4]`.
* `0 <= Node.val <= 10^4`

## Solution

```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };

class Solution {
public:
    int rob(TreeNode* root) {
        // sol: dfs (recursion), dp with two variables
        int rob, nrob;
        helper(rob, nrob, root);
        return max(rob, nrob);
    }
    
    void helper(int& rob, int& nrob, TreeNode* node) {
        if (!node) {
            rob = 0;
            nrob = 0;
            return;
        }
        int rob_left, nrob_left, rob_right, nrob_right;
        helper(rob_left, nrob_left, node->left);
        helper(rob_right, nrob_right, node->right);
        rob = node->val + nrob_left + nrob_right;
        nrob = max(rob_left, nrob_left) + max(rob_right, nrob_right);
    }
};
```
