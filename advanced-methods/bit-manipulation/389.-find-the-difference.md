# 389. Find the Difference

## Question

You are given two strings `s` and `t`.

String `t` is generated by random shuffling string `s` and then add one more letter at a random position.

Return the letter that was added to `t`.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: s = "abcd", t = "abcde"
Output: "e"
Explanation: 'e' is the letter that was added.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: s = "", t = "y"
Output: "y"
```

**Example 3:**

```text
Input: s = "a", t = "aa"
Output: "a"
```

**Example 4:**

```text
Input: s = "ae", t = "aea"
Output: "a"
```

**Constraints:**

* `0 <= s.length <= 1000`
* `t.length == s.length + 1`
* `s` and `t` consist of lower-case English letters.

## Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    char findTheDifference(string s, string t) {
        // sol: bit manipulation (use xor)
        char res = 0;
        for (auto ch : s) {
            res ^= ch;
        }
        for (auto ch : t) {
            res ^= ch;
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
