# 771. Jewels and Stones

## Question

You're given strings `jewels` representing the types of stones that are jewels, and `stones` representing the stones you have. Each character in `stones` is a type of stone you have. You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

Letters are case sensitive, so `"a"` is considered a different type of stone from `"A"`.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: jewels = "aA", stones = "aAAbbbb"
Output: 3
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: jewels = "z", stones = "ZZ"
Output: 0
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= jewels.length, stones.length <= 50`
* `jewels` and `stones` consist of only English letters.
* All the characters of `jewels` are **unique**.

## Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numJewelsInStones(string J, string S) {
        // sol: hashset
        int res = 0;
        unordered_set<char> s;
        for (char c : J) {
            s.insert(c);
        }
        for (char c : S) {
            if (s.count(c)) {
                ++res;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
