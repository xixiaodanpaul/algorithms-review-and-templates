# 734. Sentence Similarity

## Question

We can represent a sentence as an array of words, for example, the sentence `"I am happy with leetcode"` can be represented as `arr = ["I","am",happy","with","leetcode"]`.

Given two sentences `sentence1` and `sentence2` each represented as a string array and given an array of string pairs `similarPairs` where `similarPairs[i] = [xi, yi]` indicates that the two words `xi` and `yi` are similar.

Return _`true` if `sentence1` and `sentence2` are similar, or `false` if they are not similar_.

Two sentences are similar if:

* They have **the same length** \(i.e. the same number of words\)
* `sentence1[i]` and `sentence2[i]` are similar.

Notice that a word is always similar to itself, also notice that the similarity relation is not transitive. For example, if the words `a` and `b` are similar and the words `b` and `c` are similar, `a` and `c` are **not necessarily similar**.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: sentence1 = ["great","acting","skills"], sentence2 = ["fine","drama","talent"], similarPairs = [["great","fine"],["drama","acting"],["skills","talent"]]
Output: true
Explanation: The two sentences have the same length and each word i of sentence1 is also similar to the corresponding word in sentence2.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: sentence1 = ["great"], sentence2 = ["great"], similarPairs = []
Output: true
Explanation: A word is similar to itself.
```

**Example 3:**

```text
Input: sentence1 = ["great"], sentence2 = ["doubleplus","good"], similarPairs = [["great","doubleplus"]]
Output: false
Explanation: As they don't have the same length, we return false.
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= sentence1.length, sentence2.length <= 1000`
* `1 <= sentence1[i].length, sentence2[i].length <= 20`
* `sentence1[i]` and `sentence2[i]` consist of lower-case and upper-case English letters.
* `0 <= similarPairs.length <= 1000`
* `similarPairs[i].length == 2`
* `1 <= xi.length, yi.length <= 20`
* `xi` and `yi` consist of lower-case and upper-case English letters.
* All the pairs `(xi, yi)` are **distinct**.

## Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool areSentencesSimilar(vector<string>& words1, vector<string>& words2, vector<vector<string>>& pairs) {
        // sol: hashmap
        if (words1.size() != words2.size()) {
            return false;
        }
        unordered_map<string, unordered_set<string>> m;
        for (auto& p : pairs) {
            m[p[0]].insert(p[1]);
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < words1.size(); ++i) {
            if (words1[i] == words2[i]) {
                continue;
            }
            if (!m[words1[i]].count(words2[i]) && !m[words2[i]].count(words1[i])) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
};
```
