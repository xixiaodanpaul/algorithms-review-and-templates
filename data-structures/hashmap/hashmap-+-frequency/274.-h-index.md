# 274. H-Index

## Question

Given an array of integers `citations` where `citations[i]` is the number of citations a researcher received for their `ith` paper, return compute the researcher's `h`**-index**.

According to the [definition of h-index on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-index): A scientist has an index `h` if `h` of their `n` papers have at least `h` citations each, and the other `n âˆ’ h` papers have no more than `h` citations each.

If there are several possible values for `h`, the maximum one is taken as the `h`**-index**.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: citations = [3,0,6,1,5]
Output: 3
Explanation: [3,0,6,1,5] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively.
Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, their h-index is 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: citations = [1,3,1]
Output: 1
```

**Constraints:**

* `n == citations.length`
* `1 <= n <= 5000`
* `0 <= citations[i] <= 1000`

## Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int hIndex(vector<int>& citations) {
        // sol1: sort, check from large to small
        // sort(citations.begin(), citations.end(), greater<int>());
        // for (int i = 0; i < citations.size(); ++i) {
        //     if (i + 1 > citations[i]) {
        //         return i;
        //     }
        // }
        // return citations.size();
        
        // sol2: hashmap, count
        int n = citations.size();
        vector<int> counts(n + 1, 0);
        for (auto& c : citations) {
            if (c > n) {
                ++counts[n];
            } else {
                ++counts[c];
            }
        }
        int sum = counts[n], i = n;
        while (sum < i) { // until the number of citations >= i is >= i
            sum += counts[--i];
        }
        return i;
    }
};
```
