# 957. Prison Cells After N Days

## Question

There are `8` prison cells in a row and each cell is either occupied or vacant.

Each day, whether the cell is occupied or vacant changes according to the following rules:

* If a cell has two adjacent neighbors that are both occupied or both vacant, then the cell becomes occupied.
* Otherwise, it becomes vacant.

**Note** that because the prison is a row, the first and the last cells in the row can't have two adjacent neighbors.

You are given an integer array `cells` where `cells[i] == 1` if the `ith` cell is occupied and `cells[i] == 0` if the `ith` cell is vacant, and you are given an integer `n`.

Return the state of the prison after `n` days \(i.e., `n` such changes described above\).

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: cells = [0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1], n = 7
Output: [0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]
Explanation: The following table summarizes the state of the prison on each day:
Day 0: [0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1]
Day 1: [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Day 2: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0]
Day 3: [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]
Day 4: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]
Day 5: [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0]
Day 6: [0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0]
Day 7: [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: cells = [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0], n = 1000000000
Output: [0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0]
```

**Constraints:**

* `cells.length == 8`
* `cells[i]` is either `0` or `1`.
* `1 <= n <= 10^9`

## Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> prisonAfterNDays(vector<int>& cells, int N) {
        // sol: hahsmap, find cycle, bit manipulation
        int n = cells.size();
        unordered_map<int, int> m; // viisted state and index
        vector<int> next(n);
        int state = 0, idx = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            if (cells[i] == 1) {
                state ^= 1 << i;
            }
        }
        m[state] = idx++;
        while (N > 0) {
            --N;
            for (int i = 1; i < n - 1; ++i) {
                next[i] = cells[i-1] == cells[i+1] ? 1 : 0;
            }
            state = 0;
            for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
                if (next[i] == 1) {
                    state ^= 1 << i;
                }
            }
            if (m.count(state)) {
                N %= idx - m[state];
            }
            m[state] = idx++;
            cells = next;
        }
        return cells;
    }
};
```
