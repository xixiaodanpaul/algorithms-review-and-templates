# 953. Verifying an Alien Dictionary

## Question

In an alien language, surprisingly they also use english lowercase letters, but possibly in a different `order`. The `order` of the alphabet is some permutation of lowercase letters.

Given a sequence of `words` written in the alien language, and the `order` of the alphabet, return `true` if and only if the given `words` are sorted lexicographicaly in this alien language.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: words = ["hello","leetcode"], order = "hlabcdefgijkmnopqrstuvwxyz"
Output: true
Explanation: As 'h' comes before 'l' in this language, then the sequence is sorted.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: words = ["word","world","row"], order = "worldabcefghijkmnpqstuvxyz"
Output: false
Explanation: As 'd' comes after 'l' in this language, then words[0] > words[1], hence the sequence is unsorted.
```

**Example 3:**

```text
Input: words = ["apple","app"], order = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
Output: false
Explanation: The first three characters "app" match, and the second string is shorter (in size.) According to lexicographical rules "apple" > "app", because 'l' > '∅', where '∅' is defined as the blank character which is less than any other character (More info).
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= words.length <= 100`
* `1 <= words[i].length <= 20`
* `order.length == 26`
* All characters in `words[i]` and `order` are English lowercase letters.

## Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isAlienSorted(vector<string>& words, string order) {
        // sol: hashmap
        unordered_map<char, int> m; // char to index
        for (int i = 0; i < order.size(); ++i) {
            m[order[i]] = i;
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < words.size() - 1; ++i) {
            string& word1 = words[i], word2 = words[i+1];
            int min_len = min(word1.size(), word2.size());
            int j = 0;
            for (; j < min_len; ++j) {
                if (word1[j] != word2[j]) {
                    if (m[word1[j]] > m[word2[j]]) {
                        return false;
                    }
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (j == min_len && word1.size() > word2.size()) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
};
```
