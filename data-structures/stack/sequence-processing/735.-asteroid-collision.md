# 735. Asteroid Collision

## Question

We are given an array `asteroids` of integers representing asteroids in a row.

For each asteroid, the absolute value represents its size, and the sign represents its direction \(positive meaning right, negative meaning left\). Each asteroid moves at the same speed.

Find out the state of the asteroids after all collisions. If two asteroids meet, the smaller one will explode. If both are the same size, both will explode. Two asteroids moving in the same direction will never meet.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: asteroids = [5,10,-5]
Output: [5,10]
Explanation: The 10 and -5 collide resulting in 10. The 5 and 10 never collide.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: asteroids = [8,-8]
Output: []
Explanation: The 8 and -8 collide exploding each other.
```

**Example 3:**

```text
Input: asteroids = [10,2,-5]
Output: [10]
Explanation: The 2 and -5 collide resulting in -5. The 10 and -5 collide resulting in 10.
```

**Example 4:**

```text
Input: asteroids = [-2,-1,1,2]
Output: [-2,-1,1,2]
Explanation: The -2 and -1 are moving left, while the 1 and 2 are moving right. Asteroids moving the same direction never meet, so no asteroids will meet each other.
```

**Constraints:**

* `2 <= asteroids.length <= 10^4`
* `-1000 <= asteroids[i] <= 1000`
* `asteroids[i] != 0`

## Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> asteroidCollision(vector<int>& asteroids) {
        // sol: stack (use vector as stack)
        vector<int> res;
        for (auto a : asteroids) {
            if (a > 0) {
                res.push_back(a);
                continue;
            }
            while (!res.empty() && res.back() > 0 && res.back() < abs(a)) {
                res.pop_back();
            }
            if (res.empty() || res.back() < 0) {
                res.push_back(a);
            } else if (res.back() == abs(a)) {
                res.pop_back();
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
