# 419. Battleships in a Board

## Question

Given an `m x n` matrix `board` where each cell is a battleship `'X'` or empty `'.'`, return _the number of the **battleships** on_ `board`.

**Battleships** can only be placed horizontally or vertically on `board`. In other words, they can only be made of the shape `1 x k` \(`1` row, `k` columns\) or `k x 1` \(`k` rows, `1` column\), where `k` can be of any size. At least one horizontal or vertical cell separates between two battleships \(i.e., there are no adjacent battleships\).

**Example 1:**![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/04/10/battelship-grid.jpg)

```text
Input: board = [["X",".",".","X"],[".",".",".","X"],[".",".",".","X"]]
Output: 2
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: board = [["."]]
Output: 0
```

**Constraints:**

* `m == board.length`
* `n == board[i].length`
* `1 <= m, n <= 200`
* `board[i][j]` is either `'.'` or `'X'`.

**Follow up:** Could you do it in one-pass, using only `O(1)` extra memory and without modifying the values `board`?

## Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int countBattleships(vector<vector<char>>& board) {
        // sol: find start nodes
        if (board.empty() || board[0].empty()) {
            return 0;
        }
        int m = board.size(), n = board[0].size(), res = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
                if (board[i][j] == 'X' && (i == 0 || board[i - 1][j] == '.') && (j == 0 || board[i][j - 1] == '.')) {
                    ++res;
                }
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
