# 766. Toeplitz Matrix

## Question

Given an `m x n` `matrix`, return _`true` if the matrix is Toeplitz. Otherwise, return `false`._

A matrix is **Toeplitz** if every diagonal from top-left to bottom-right has the same elements.

**Example 1:**![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/04/ex1.jpg)

```text
Input: matrix = [[1,2,3,4],[5,1,2,3],[9,5,1,2]]
Output: true
Explanation:
In the above grid, the diagonals are:
"[9]", "[5, 5]", "[1, 1, 1]", "[2, 2, 2]", "[3, 3]", "[4]".
In each diagonal all elements are the same, so the answer is True.
```

**Example 2:**![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/04/ex2.jpg)

```text
Input: matrix = [[1,2],[2,2]]
Output: false
Explanation:
The diagonal "[1, 2]" has different elements.
```

**Constraints:**

* `m == matrix.length`
* `n == matrix[i].length`
* `1 <= m, n <= 20`
* `0 <= matrix[i][j] <= 99`

**Follow up:**

* What if the `matrix` is stored on disk, and the memory is limited such that you can only load at most one row of the matrix into the memory at once?
* What if the `matrix` is so large that you can only load up a partial row into the memory at once?

## Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isToeplitzMatrix(vector<vector<int>>& matrix) {
        // sol: compare with top-left number
        for (int i = 0; i < matrix.size(); ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < matrix[0].size(); ++j) {
                if (i > 0 && j > 0 && matrix[i-1][j-1] != matrix[i][j]) {
                    return false;
                }
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
};
```
