# 186. Reverse Words in a String II

## Question

Given a character array `s`, reverse the order of the **words**.

A **word** is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The **words** in `s` will be separated by a single space.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: s = ["t","h","e"," ","s","k","y"," ","i","s"," ","b","l","u","e"]
Output: ["b","l","u","e"," ","i","s"," ","s","k","y"," ","t","h","e"]
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: s = ["a"]
Output: ["a"]
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= s.length <= 10^5`
* `s[i]` is an English letter \(uppercase or lowercase\), digit, or space `' '`.
* There is **at least one** word in `s`.
* `s` does not contain leading or trailing spaces.
* All the words in `s` are guaranteed to be separated by a single space.

 **Follow up:** Could you do it **in-place** without allocating extra space?

## Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    void reverseWords(vector<char>& s) {
        // sol: reverse whole string, then reverse each word
        reverse(s.begin(), s.end());
        int i = 0, j = 0;
        while (i < s.size()) {
            for (j = i; j < s.size(); ++j) {
                if (s[j] == ' ') {
                    break;
                }
            }
            reverse(s.begin() + i, s.begin() + j);
            i = j + 1;
        }
    }
};
```
