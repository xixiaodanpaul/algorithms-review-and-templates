# 414. Third Maximum Number

## Question

Given integer array `nums`, return _the third maximum number in this array_. If the third maximum does not exist, return the maximum number.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: nums = [3,2,1]
Output: 1
Explanation: The third maximum is 1.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: nums = [1,2]
Output: 2
Explanation: The third maximum does not exist, so the maximum (2) is returned instead.
```

**Example 3:**

```text
Input: nums = [2,2,3,1]
Output: 1
Explanation: Note that the third maximum here means the third maximum distinct number.
Both numbers with value 2 are both considered as second maximum.
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= nums.length <= 10^4`
* `-2^31 <= nums[i] <= 2^31 - 1`

## Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int thirdMax(vector<int>& nums) {
        // sol: track three max numbers
        long first = LONG_MIN, second = LONG_MIN, third = LONG_MIN;
        for (int num : nums) {
            if (num > first) {
                third = second;
                second = first;
                first = num;
            } else if (num > second && num < first) {
                third = second;
                second = num;
            } else if (num > third && num < second) {
                third = num;
            }
        }
        return third == LONG_MIN ? first : third;
    }
};
```
