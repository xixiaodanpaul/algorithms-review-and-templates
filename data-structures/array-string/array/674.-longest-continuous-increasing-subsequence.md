# 674. Longest Continuous Increasing Subsequence

## Question

Given an unsorted array of integers `nums`, return _the length of the longest **continuous increasing subsequence** \(i.e. subarray\)_. The subsequence must be **strictly** increasing.

A **continuous increasing subsequence** is defined by two indices `l` and `r` \(`l < r`\) such that it is `[nums[l], nums[l + 1], ..., nums[r - 1], nums[r]]` and for each `l <= i < r`, `nums[i] < nums[i + 1]`.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: nums = [1,3,5,4,7]
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest continuous increasing subsequence is [1,3,5] with length 3.
Even though [1,3,5,7] is an increasing subsequence, it is not continuous as elements 5 and 7 are separated by element
4.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: nums = [2,2,2,2,2]
Output: 1
Explanation: The longest continuous increasing subsequence is [2] with length 1. Note that it must be strictly
increasing.
```

**Constraints:**

* `0 <= nums.length <= 10^4`
* `-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`

## Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findLengthOfLCIS(vector<int>& nums) {
        // sol: one pass
        int res = 0, len = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
            if (i == 0 || nums[i] > nums[i-1]) {
                ++len;
            } else {
                res = max(res, len);
                len = 1;
            }
        }
        return max(res, len);
    }
};
```
