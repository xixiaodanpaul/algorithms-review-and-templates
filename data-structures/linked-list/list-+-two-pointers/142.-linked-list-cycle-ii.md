# 142. Linked List Cycle II

## Question

Given a linked list, return the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return `null`.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the `next` pointer. Internally, `pos` is used to denote the index of the node that tail's `next` pointer is connected to. **Note that `pos` is not passed as a parameter**.

**Notice** that you **should not modify** the linked list.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/07/circularlinkedlist.png)

```
Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: tail connects to node index 1
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the second node.
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/07/circularlinkedlist\_test2.png)

```
Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
Output: tail connects to node index 0
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the first node.
```

**Example 3:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/07/circularlinkedlist\_test3.png)

```
Input: head = [1], pos = -1
Output: no cycle
Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.
```

**Constraints:**

* The number of the nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 10^4]`.
* `-10^5 <= Node.val <= 10^5`
* `pos` is `-1` or a **valid index** in the linked-list.

**Follow up:** Can you solve it using `O(1)` (i.e. constant) memory?

## Solution

#### C++

```cpp
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * struct ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode *next;
 *     ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode *detectCycle(ListNode *head) {
        // sol: two pointers
        if (!head || !head->next) {
            return NULL;
        }
        ListNode* slow = head;
        ListNode* fast = head;
        while (fast && fast->next) {
            slow = slow->next;
            fast = fast->next->next;
            if (slow == fast) {
                break;
            }
        }
        if (!fast || !fast->next) {
            return NULL;
        }
        // head to begin node = meeting point to begin node
        slow = head;
        while (slow != fast) {
            slow = slow->next;
            fast = fast->next;
        }
        return slow;
    }
};
```

#### Java

```java
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode(int x) {
 *         val = x;
 *         next = null;
 *     }
 * }
 */

// sol: two pointers
public class Solution {
    public ListNode detectCycle(ListNode head) {
        ListNode slow = head;
        ListNode fast = head;
        while (fast != null && fast.next != null) {
            slow = slow.next;
            fast = fast.next.next;
            if (slow == fast) {
                break;
            }
        }
        if (fast == null || fast.next == null) {
            return null;
        }
        // head to begin node = meeting point to begin node
        slow = head;
        while (slow != fast) {
            slow = slow.next;
            fast = fast.next;
        }
        return slow;
    }
}
```
