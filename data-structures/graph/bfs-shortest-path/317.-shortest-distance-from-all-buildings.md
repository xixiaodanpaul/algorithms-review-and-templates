# 317. Shortest Distance from All Buildings

## Question

You are given an `m x n` grid `grid` of values `0`, `1`, or `2`, where:

* each `0` marks **an empty land** that you can pass by freely,
* each `1` marks **a building** that you cannot pass through, and
* each `2` marks **an obstacle** that you cannot pass through.

You want to build a house on an empty land that reaches all buildings in the **shortest total travel** distance. You can only move up, down, left, and right.

Return _the **shortest travel distance** for such a house_. If it is not possible to build such a house according to the above rules, return `-1`.

The **total travel distance** is the sum of the distances between the houses of the friends and the meeting point.

The distance is calculated using [Manhattan Distance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_geometry), where `distance(p1, p2) = |p2.x - p1.x| + |p2.y - p1.y|`.

**Example 1:**![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/14/buildings-grid.jpg)

```text
Input: grid = [[1,0,2,0,1],[0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,1,0,0]]
Output: 7
Explanation: Given three buildings at (0,0), (0,4), (2,2), and an obstacle at (0,2).
The point (1,2) is an ideal empty land to build a house, as the total travel distance of 3+3+1=7 is minimal.
So return 7.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: grid = [[1,0]]
Output: 1
```

**Example 3:**

```text
Input: grid = [[1]]
Output: -1
```

**Constraints:**

* `m == grid.length`
* `n == grid[i].length`
* `1 <= m, n <= 100`
* `grid[i][j]` is either `0`, `1`, or `2`.
* There will be **at least one** building in the `grid`.
