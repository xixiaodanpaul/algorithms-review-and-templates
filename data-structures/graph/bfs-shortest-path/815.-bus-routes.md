# 815. Bus Routes

## Question

You are given an array `routes` representing bus routes where `routes[i]` is a bus route that the `ith` bus repeats forever.

* For example, if `routes[0] = [1, 5, 7]`, this means that the `0th` bus travels in the sequence `1 -> 5 -> 7 -> 1 -> 5 -> 7 -> 1 -> ...` forever.

You will start at the bus stop `source` \(You are not on any bus initially\), and you want to go to the bus stop `target`. You can travel between bus stops by buses only.

Return _the least number of buses you must take to travel from_ `source` _to_ `target`. Return `-1` if it is not possible.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: routes = [[1,2,7],[3,6,7]], source = 1, target = 6
Output: 2
Explanation: The best strategy is take the first bus to the bus stop 7, then take the second bus to the bus stop 6.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: routes = [[7,12],[4,5,15],[6],[15,19],[9,12,13]], source = 15, target = 12
Output: -1
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= routes.length <= 500`.
* `1 <= routes[i].length <= 10^5`
* All the values of `routes[i]` are **unique**.
* `sum(routes[i].length) <= 10^5`
* `0 <= routes[i][j] < 10^6`
* `0 <= source, target < 10^6`

## Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numBusesToDestination(vector<vector<int>>& routes, int S, int T) {
        // sol: bfs, hashmap
        int n = routes.size();
        unordered_map<int, vector<int>> m; // map stop to bus
        vector<bool> visited_bus(n, false);
        unordered_set<int> visited_stop;
        queue<int> q;
        int res = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            for (int s : routes[i]) {
                m[s].push_back(i);
            }
        }
        q.push(S);
        visited_stop.insert(S);
        while (!q.empty()) {
            int size = q.size();
            for (int i = 0; i < size; ++i) {
                int t = q.front();
                q.pop();
                if (t == T) {
                    return res;
                }
                for (int b : m[t]) {
                    if (visited_bus[b]) {
                        continue;
                    }
                    visited_bus[b] = true;
                    for (int s : routes[b]) {
                        if (visited_stop.count(s)) {
                            continue;
                        }
                        q.push(s);
                        visited_stop.insert(s);
                    }
                }
            }
            ++res;
        }
        return -1;
    }
};
```
