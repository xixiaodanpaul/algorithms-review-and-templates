# 773. Sliding Puzzle

## Question

On a 2x3 `board`, there are 5 tiles represented by the integers 1 through 5, and an empty square represented by 0.

A move consists of choosing `0` and a 4-directionally adjacent number and swapping it.

The state of the board is _solved_ if and only if the `board` is `[[1,2,3],[4,5,0]].`

Given a puzzle board, return the least number of moves required so that the state of the board is solved. If it is impossible for the state of the board to be solved, return -1.

**Examples:**

```text
Input: board = [[1,2,3],[4,0,5]]
Output: 1
Explanation: Swap the 0 and the 5 in one move.
```

```text
Input: board = [[1,2,3],[5,4,0]]
Output: -1
Explanation: No number of moves will make the board solved.
```

```text
Input: board = [[4,1,2],[5,0,3]]
Output: 5
Explanation: 5 is the smallest number of moves that solves the board.
An example path:
After move 0: [[4,1,2],[5,0,3]]
After move 1: [[4,1,2],[0,5,3]]
After move 2: [[0,1,2],[4,5,3]]
After move 3: [[1,0,2],[4,5,3]]
After move 4: [[1,2,0],[4,5,3]]
After move 5: [[1,2,3],[4,5,0]]
```

```text
Input: board = [[3,2,4],[1,5,0]]
Output: 14
```

**Note:**

* `board` will be a 2 x 3 array as described above.
* `board[i][j]` will be a permutation of `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.

## Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int slidingPuzzle(vector<vector<int>>& board) {
        // sol: bfs
        int m = board.size(), n = board[0].size();
        queue<pair<int, vector<vector<int>>>> q; // first: r * n + c, second: state
        set<vector<vector<int>>> visited; // visited states
        vector<vector<int>> target{{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 0}};
        vector<vector<int>> dirs{{0, -1}, {-1, 0}, {0, 1}, {1, 0}};
        int res = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
                if (board[i][j] == 0) {
                    q.push({i * n + j, board});
                    visited.insert(board);
                }
            }
        }
        while (!q.empty()) {
            int size = q.size();
            for (int i = 0; i < size; ++i) {
                auto t = q.front();
                q.pop();
                int r = t.first / n, c = t.first % n;
                auto state = t.second;
                if (state == target) {
                    return res;
                }
                for (auto& dir : dirs) {
                    int x = r + dir[0], y = c + dir[1];
                    if (x < 0 || x >= m || y < 0 || y >= n) {
                        continue;
                    }
                    vector<vector<int>> new_state(state);
                    swap(new_state[r][c], new_state[x][y]);
                    if (visited.count(new_state)) {
                        continue;
                    }
                    q.push({x * n + y, new_state});
                    visited.insert(new_state);
                }
            }
            ++res;
        }
        return -1;
    }
};
```
