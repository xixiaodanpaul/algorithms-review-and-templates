# 332. Reconstruct Itinerary

## Question

You are given a list of airline `tickets` where `tickets[i] = [fromi, toi]` represent the departure and the arrival airports of one flight. Reconstruct the itinerary in order and return it.

All of the tickets belong to a man who departs from `"JFK"`, thus, the itinerary must begin with `"JFK"`. If there are multiple valid itineraries, you should return the itinerary that has the smallest lexical order when read as a single string.

* For example, the itinerary `["JFK", "LGA"]` has a smaller lexical order than `["JFK", "LGB"]`.

You may assume all tickets form at least one valid itinerary. You must use all the tickets once and only once.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: tickets = [["MUC","LHR"],["JFK","MUC"],["SFO","SJC"],["LHR","SFO"]]
Output: ["JFK","MUC","LHR","SFO","SJC"]
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/14/itinerary2-graph.jpg)

```text
Input: tickets = [["JFK","SFO"],["JFK","ATL"],["SFO","ATL"],["ATL","JFK"],["ATL","SFO"]]
Output: ["JFK","ATL","JFK","SFO","ATL","SFO"]
Explanation: Another possible reconstruction is ["JFK","SFO","ATL","JFK","ATL","SFO"] but it is larger in lexical order.
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= tickets.length <= 300`
* `tickets[i].length == 2`
* `fromi.length == 3`
* `toi.length == 3`
* `fromi` and `toi` consist of uppercase English letters.
* `fromi != toi`

## Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<string> findItinerary(vector<vector<string>>& tickets) {
        // sol: dfs, hashmap, ordered multiset
        vector<string> res;
        unordered_map<string, multiset<string>> m;
        for (auto& t : tickets) {
            m[t[0]].insert(t[1]);
        }
        helper("JFK", res, m);
        reverse(res.begin(), res.end()); // return reserved path
        return res;
    }
    
    void helper(string s, vector<string>& res, unordered_map<string, multiset<string>>& m) {
        while (!m[s].empty()) {
            string t = *(m[s].begin());
            m[s].erase(m[s].begin());
            helper(t, res, m);
        }
        res.push_back(s);
    }
};
```
