# 133. Clone Graph

## Question

Given a reference of a node in a [**connected**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectivity_%28graph_theory%29#Connected_graph) undirected graph.

Return a [**deep copy**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_copying#Deep_copy) \(clone\) of the graph.

Each node in the graph contains a value \(`int`\) and a list \(`List[Node]`\) of its neighbors.

```text
class Node {
    public int val;
    public List<Node> neighbors;
}
```

**Test case format:**

For simplicity, each node's value is the same as the node's index \(1-indexed\). For example, the first node with `val == 1`, the second node with `val == 2`, and so on. The graph is represented in the test case using an adjacency list.

**An adjacency list** is a collection of unordered **lists** used to represent a finite graph. Each list describes the set of neighbors of a node in the graph.

The given node will always be the first node with `val = 1`. You must return the **copy of the given node** as a reference to the cloned graph.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/11/04/133_clone_graph_question.png)

```text
Input: adjList = [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
Output: [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
Explanation: There are 4 nodes in the graph.
1st node (val = 1)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).
2nd node (val = 2)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).
3rd node (val = 3)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).
4th node (val = 4)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).
```

**Example 2:**![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/01/07/graph.png)

```text
Input: adjList = [[]]
Output: [[]]
Explanation: Note that the input contains one empty list. The graph consists of only one node with val = 1 and it does not have any neighbors.
```

**Example 3:**

```text
Input: adjList = []
Output: []
Explanation: This an empty graph, it does not have any nodes.
```

**Example 4:**![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/01/07/graph-1.png)

```text
Input: adjList = [[2],[1]]
Output: [[2],[1]]
```

**Constraints:**

* The number of nodes in the graph is in the range `[0, 100]`.
* `1 <= Node.val <= 100`
* `Node.val` is unique for each node.
* There are no repeated edges and no self-loops in the graph.
* The Graph is connected and all nodes can be visited starting from the given node.

## Solution

```cpp
/*
// Definition for a Node.
class Node {
public:
    int val;
    vector<Node*> neighbors;
    
    Node() {
        val = 0;
        neighbors = vector<Node*>();
    }
    
    Node(int _val) {
        val = _val;
        neighbors = vector<Node*>();
    }
    
    Node(int _val, vector<Node*> _neighbors) {
        val = _val;
        neighbors = _neighbors;
    }
};
*/

//     }
        
        // sol2: bfs, hashmap
        if (!node) {
            return NULL;
        }
        queue<Node*> q;

                        m[n] = clone_n;
                    }
                    m[t]->neighbors.push_back(m[n]);
