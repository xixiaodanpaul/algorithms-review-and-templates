# 305. Number of Islands II

## Question

You are given an empty 2D binary grid `grid` of size `m x n`. The grid represents a map where `0`'s represent water and `1`'s represent land. Initially, all the cells of `grid` are water cells \(i.e., all the cells are `0`'s\).

We may perform an add land operation which turns the water at position into a land. You are given an array `positions` where `positions[i] = [ri, ci]` is the position `(ri, ci)` at which we should operate the `ith` operation.

Return _an array of integers_ `answer` _where_ `answer[i]` _is the number of islands after turning the cell_ `(ri, ci)` _into a land_.

An **island** is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

**Example 1:**![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/10/tmp-grid.jpg)

```text
Input: m = 3, n = 3, positions = [[0,0],[0,1],[1,2],[2,1]]
Output: [1,1,2,3]
Explanation:
Initially, the 2d grid is filled with water.
- Operation #1: addLand(0, 0) turns the water at grid[0][0] into a land. We have 1 island.
- Operation #2: addLand(0, 1) turns the water at grid[0][1] into a land. We still have 1 island.
- Operation #3: addLand(1, 2) turns the water at grid[1][2] into a land. We have 2 islands.
- Operation #4: addLand(2, 1) turns the water at grid[2][1] into a land. We have 3 islands.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: m = 1, n = 1, positions = [[0,0]]
Output: [1]
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= m, n, positions.length <= 10^4`
* `1 <= m * n <= 10^4`
* `positions[i].length == 2`
* `0 <= ri < m`
* `0 <= ci < n`

**Follow up:** Could you solve it in time complexity `O(k log(mn))`, where `k == positions.length`?

## Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> numIslands2(int m, int n, vector<vector<int>>& positions) {
        // sol: union find
        vector<int> roots(m * n, -1);
        vector<int> res;
        int cnt = 0;
        vector<vector<int>> dirs = {{0, -1}, {-1, 0}, {0, 1}, {1, 0}};
        for (auto pos : positions) {
            int id = pos[0] * n + pos[1];
            if (roots[id] == -1) {
                roots[id] = id;
                ++cnt;
                for (auto dir : dirs) {
                    int x = pos[0] + dir[0], y = pos[1] + dir[1];
                    int surr_id = x * n + y;
                    if (x < 0 || x >= m || y < 0 || y >= n || roots[surr_id] == -1) {
                        continue;
                    }
                    int surr_root = find(surr_id, roots);
                    if (surr_root != id) { // combine and reduce island number
                        roots[surr_root] = id;
                        --cnt;
                    }
                }
            }
            res.push_back(cnt);
        }
        return res;
    }
    
    int find(int id, vector<int>& roots) {
        while (roots[id] != id) {
            id = roots[id];
        }
        return id;
    }
};
```
