# 675. Cut Off Trees for Golf Event

## Question

You are asked to cut off all the trees in a forest for a golf event. The forest is represented as an `m x n` matrix. In this matrix:

* `0` means the cell cannot be walked through.
* `1` represents an empty cell that can be walked through.
* A number greater than `1` represents a tree in a cell that can be walked through, and this number is the tree's height.

In one step, you can walk in any of the four directions: north, east, south, and west. If you are standing in a cell with a tree, you can choose whether to cut it off.

You must cut off the trees in order from shortest to tallest. When you cut off a tree, the value at its cell becomes `1` \(an empty cell\).

Starting from the point `(0, 0)`, return _the minimum steps you need to walk to cut off all the trees_. If you cannot cut off all the trees, return `-1`.

You are guaranteed that no two trees have the same height, and there is at least one tree needs to be cut off.

**Example 1:**![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/26/trees1.jpg)

```text
Input: forest = [[1,2,3],[0,0,4],[7,6,5]]
Output: 6
Explanation: Following the path above allows you to cut off the trees from shortest to tallest in 6 steps.
```

**Example 2:**![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/26/trees2.jpg)

```text
Input: forest = [[1,2,3],[0,0,0],[7,6,5]]
Output: -1
Explanation: The trees in the bottom row cannot be accessed as the middle row is blocked.
```

**Example 3:**

```text
Input: forest = [[2,3,4],[0,0,5],[8,7,6]]
Output: 6
Explanation: You can follow the same path as Example 1 to cut off all the trees.
Note that you can cut off the first tree at (0, 0) before making any steps.
```

**Constraints:**

* `m == forest.length`
* `n == forest[i].length`
* `1 <= m, n <= 50`
* `0 <= forest[i][j] <= 10^9`

## Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int cutOffTree(vector<vector<int>>& forest) {
        // sol: sort and bfs (shortest path)
        int m = forest.size(), n = forest[0].size();
        vector<vector<int>> trees;
        int res = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
                if (forest[i][j] > 1) {
                    trees.push_back({forest[i][j], i, j});
                }
            }
        }
        sort(trees.begin(), trees.end());
        int row = 0, col = 0;
        for (auto& tree : trees) {
            int cnt = bfs(row, col, tree[1], tree[2], forest);
            if (cnt == -1) {
                return -1;
            }
            res += cnt;
            row = tree[1];
            col = tree[2];
        }
        return res;
    }
    
    int bfs(int row, int col, int nextRow, int nextCol, vector<vector<int>>& forest) {
        if (row == nextRow && col == nextCol) { // initial condition
            return 0;
        }
        int m = forest.size(), n = forest[0].size();
        queue<int> q;
        vector<vector<bool>> visited(m, vector<bool>(n, false));
        vector<vector<int>> dirs{{0, 1}, {0, -1}, {1, 0}, {-1, 0}};
        int cnt = 1;
        q.push(row * n + col);
        while (!q.empty()) {
            int size = q.size();
            for (int i = 0; i < size; ++i) {
                auto t = q.front();
                q.pop();
                int r = t / n, c = t % n;
                for (auto& dir : dirs) {
                    int x = r + dir[0], y = c + dir[1];
                    if (x < 0 || x >= m || y < 0 || y >= n || visited[x][y] == 1 || forest[x][y] == 0) {
                        continue;
                    }
                    if (x == nextRow && y == nextCol) {
                        return cnt;
                    }
                    visited[x][y] = true;
                    q.push(x * n + y);
                }
            }
            ++cnt;
        }
        return -1;
    }
};
