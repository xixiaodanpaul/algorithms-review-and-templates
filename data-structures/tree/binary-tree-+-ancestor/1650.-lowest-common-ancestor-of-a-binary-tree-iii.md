# 1650. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree III

## Question

Given two nodes of a binary tree `p` and `q`, return _their lowest common ancestor \(LCA\)_.

Each node will have a reference to its parent node. The definition for `Node` is below:

```text
class Node {
    public int val;
    public Node left;
    public Node right;
    public Node parent;
}
```

According to the [**definition of LCA on Wikipedia**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_common_ancestor): "The lowest common ancestor of two nodes p and q in a tree T is the lowest node that has both p and q as descendants \(where we allow **a node to be a descendant of itself**\)."

**Example 1:**![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/14/binarytree.png)

```text
Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 1
Output: 3
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 1 is 3.
```

**Example 2:**![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/14/binarytree.png)

```text
Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 4
Output: 5
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 4 is 5 since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.
```

**Example 3:**

```text
Input: root = [1,2], p = 1, q = 2
Output: 1
```

**Constraints:**

* The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[2, 10^5]`.
* `-10^9 <= Node.val <= 10^9`
* All `Node.val` are **unique**.
* `p != q`
* `p` and `q` exist in the tree.

## Solution

```cpp
/*
// Definition for a Node.
class Node {
public:
    int val;
    Node* left;
    Node* right;
    Node* parent;
};
*/

class Solution {
public:
    Node* lowestCommonAncestor(Node* p, Node * q) {
        // sol: two pointers (make two cycles, same with intersection of two linked lists)
        Node* a = p;
        Node* b = q;
        while(a != b) {
            a = a ? a->parent : q;
            b = b ? b->parent : p;  
        }
        return a;
    }
};
```
