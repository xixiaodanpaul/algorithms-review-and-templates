# 236. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree

## Question

Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor \(LCA\) of two given nodes in the tree.

According to the [definition of LCA on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_common_ancestor): “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes `p` and `q` as the lowest node in `T` that has both `p` and `q` as descendants \(where we allow **a node to be a descendant of itself**\).”

**Example 1:**![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/14/binarytree.png)

```text
Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 1
Output: 3
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 1 is 3.
```

**Example 2:**![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/14/binarytree.png)

```text
Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 4
Output: 5
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 4 is 5, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.
```

**Example 3:**

```text
Input: root = [1,2], p = 1, q = 2
Output: 1
```

**Constraints:**

* The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[2, 10^5]`.
* `-10^9 <= Node.val <= 10^9`
* All `Node.val` are **unique**.
* `p != q`
* `p` and `q` will exist in the tree.

## Solution

```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* lowestCommonAncestor(TreeNode* root, TreeNode* p, TreeNode* q) {
        // sol: recursion
        return helper(root, p, q);
    }

    TreeNode* helper(TreeNode* node, TreeNode* p, TreeNode* q) {
        if (!node) {
            return NULL;
        }
        if (node->val == p->val || node->val == q->val) {
            return node;
        }
        TreeNode* left = helper(node->left, p, q);
        TreeNode* right = helper(node->right, p, q);
        if (left && right) {
            return node;
        }
        return left ? left : right;
    }
};
```
