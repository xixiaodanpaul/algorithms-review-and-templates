# 895. Maximum Frequency Stack

## Question

Design a stack-like data structure to push elements to the stack and pop the most frequent element from the stack.

Implement the `FreqStack` class:

* `FreqStack()` constructs an empty frequency stack.
* `void push(int val)` pushes an integer `val` onto the top of the stack.
* `int pop()` removes and returns the most frequent element in the stack.
  * If there is a tie for the most frequent element, the element closest to the stack's top is removed and returned.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input
["FreqStack", "push", "push", "push", "push", "push", "push", "pop", "pop", "pop", "pop"]
[[], [5], [7], [5], [7], [4], [5], [], [], [], []]
Output
[null, null, null, null, null, null, null, 5, 7, 5, 4]

Explanation
FreqStack freqStack = new FreqStack();
freqStack.push(5); // The stack is [5]
freqStack.push(7); // The stack is [5,7]
freqStack.push(5); // The stack is [5,7,5]
freqStack.push(7); // The stack is [5,7,5,7]
freqStack.push(4); // The stack is [5,7,5,7,4]
freqStack.push(5); // The stack is [5,7,5,7,4,5]
freqStack.pop();   // return 5, as 5 is the most frequent. The stack becomes [5,7,5,7,4].
freqStack.pop();   // return 7, as 5 and 7 is the most frequent, but 7 is closest to the top. The stack becomes [5,7,5,4].
freqStack.pop();   // return 5, as 5 is the most frequent. The stack becomes [5,7,4].
freqStack.pop();   // return 4, as 4, 5 and 7 is the most frequent, but 4 is closest to the top. The stack becomes [5,7].
```

**Constraints:**

* `0 <= val <= 10^9`
* At most `2 * 10^4` calls will be made to `push` and `pop`.
* It is guaranteed that there will be at least one element in the stack before calling `pop`.

## Solution

```cpp
class FreqStack {
public:
    // sol: hashmap, stack
    FreqStack() : max_freq(0) {}
    
    void push(int x) {
        max_freq = max(max_freq, ++freq[x]);
        bucket[freq[x]].push(x);
    }
    
    int pop() {
        int t = bucket[max_freq].top();
        bucket[max_freq].pop();
        if (bucket[max_freq].empty()) {
            bucket.erase(max_freq);
            --max_freq; // there must be a number with (max_freq-1) frequency, because t is one
        }
        --freq[t];
        return t;
    }
    
private:
    int max_freq;
    unordered_map<int, int> freq;
    unordered_map<int, stack<int>> bucket;
};

/**
 * Your FreqStack object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * FreqStack* obj = new FreqStack();
 * obj->push(x);
 * int param_2 = obj->pop();
 */
```
